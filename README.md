Hey there! :)

I'm vignesh,mostly known on the internet as software tester in micromax community,a 18 years old student from india,I'm currently purshing my second bachelor degree at vsb engineering college at karur in the steam of artificial intelligence and data science(ai&ds).

I have always been fascinated by technology and software development, which is why I am thrilled to be a part of the Micromax community and to be able to test Android OS. As a student, I am constantly looking for ways to improve myself and learn new things, and my involvement in this community is a great way for me to do just that. When I'm not busy testing Android OS, I enjoy spending time with my friends and pursuing my hobbies.

Whether it's playing sports, listening to music, or reading a good book, I always make time for the things that I love. Overall, I am a motivated and enthusiastic individual who is passionate about technology and software development. I am grateful for the opportunities that the Micromax community has provided me and look forward to contributing to its success in any way that I can.
